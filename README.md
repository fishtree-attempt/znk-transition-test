# How to Cross Stitch

This repository contains chapters on cross stitching, primarily written by Dr. Sarah Gibson.

[_The Turing Way_](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way) team members wanted to test The Carpentries [lesson template](https://github.com/carpentries/lesson-example) so that they could use it for hosting lessons relevant for _The Turing Way_ project.

A lesson on cross stitch like a good example to start with for the following reasons:

- _The Turing Way_ team (with the great help of Sarah) gave out a starter packages with a how-to manual to their book dash attendees as a thank you gift
- Sarah , who is a research software engineer, has discovered that cross stitch allows her to gently exercise her analytical skills in a hobby environment
