# Cross Stitch Carpentry

*Welcome to this project repository!*

This repository contains chapters on cross stitching, primarily written by Dr. Sarah Gibson, an expert cross stitcher. 
To promote self care among their contributors, _The Turing Way_ team (with the great help of Sarah and Kirstie) gave out a starter packages with a how-to manual to their book dash attendees as a thank you gift.

That starter's manual has been converted into this Carpentries style lesson.

Sarah , who is a research software engineer, uses cross stitch as a way to gently exercise her analytical skills in a hobby environment.

The co-author, Malvika Sharan, is a novice cross stitcher, who received her first kit as an adult from Sarah at The Turinhg Way Book Dash and went on to dig into more evidences on why cross stitch is useful and we can promote such hobbies among researchers with a fast paced digital life.

They co-created this lesson to make cross stitching an accessible hobby for programmers and data scientists that can help them bring mindfulness into their everyday life and boost mental health.

Furthermore, [_The Turing Way_](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way) team members will use this lesson as a good example to test The Carpentries [lesson template](https://github.com/carpentries/lesson-example) so that they could use it for hosting lessons relevant for _The Turing Way_ project in the future.
