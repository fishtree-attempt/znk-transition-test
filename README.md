# Cross Stitch Carpentry

*Welcome to this project repository!*

This repository contains chapters on cross stitching, primarily written by Dr. Sarah Gibson, an expert cross stitcher. 
To promote self care among their contributors, _The Turing Way_ team (with the great help of Sarah and Kirstie) gave out a starter packages with a how-to manual to their book dash attendees as a thank you gift.

That starter's manual has been converted into this Carpentries style lesson.

Sarah , who is a research software engineer, uses cross stitch as a way to gently exercise her analytical skills in a hobby environment.

The co-author, Malvika Sharan, is a novice cross stitcher, who received her first kit as an adult from Sarah at _The Turing Way_ Book Dash and went on to dig into more evidences on why cross stitch is useful and we can promote such hobbies among researchers with a fast paced digital life.

They co-created this lesson to make cross stitching an accessible hobby for programmers and data scientists that can help them bring mindfulness into their everyday life and boost mental health.

Furthermore, [_The Turing Way_](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way) team members will use this lesson as a good example to test The Carpentries [lesson template](https://github.com/carpentries/lesson-example) so that they could use it for hosting lessons relevant for _The Turing Way_ project in the future.
