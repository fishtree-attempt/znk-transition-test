## What do we need to start Cross Stitching?

- [Pattern chart](#pattern-chart)
- [Fabric](#fabric)
- [Coloured thread](#coloured-thread)
- [Needle](#needle)
- [Scissors](#scissors)
- [A needle threader](#needle-threader) (optional)
- [A needle minder](#needle-minder) (optional)

### Pattern chart

The pattern chart is a gridded piece of paper that lays out the design we'd like to stitch.
Each square on the grid represents one full cross stitch and the grid often has a 10x10 square grid in **bold** to assist with counting.
The pattern chart will contain symbols within the grid and a key that links each symbol to the number of coloured thread we should use to create that stitch with.
The colours and layout of the stitches will help build up our pattern.

### Fabric

We also need something to stitch onto, which is usually some kind of fabric.
The fabric most commonly used for cross stitch embroidery is called ["aida"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aida_cloth).
Aida is useful for cross stitching as it is woven in such a way that it has evenly-spaced holes that form the corners of our stitches.
It is a type of "even weave" fabric, which means that the number of threads in the vertical direction matches the number of threads in the horizontal direction.

### Coloured thread

We also need some coloured thread to make our stitches with!
In the key of the pattern chart, there'll be a list of numbers that correspond to the coloured thread you'll need to complete the pattern.
There are many different brands of thread you could use and which brand the chart maker had in mind should be listed on the pattern chart too.
This is because the colour numbers don't match up between brands!
A brand called [DMC](https://www.dmc.com/) is most commonly used for cross stitching, but you may also see [Anchor](https://anchorcrafts.com/) being referred to.

### Needle

We can't do needlepoint without a needle!
We recommend using a Size 24 cross stitching needle.
This type of needle is quite blunt so you don't have to worry about injuring yourself while stitching.
These can also be purchased from DMC.

### Scissors

It will be handy to have a pair of scissors around to cut loose ends of thread with.
You could purchase a set of [embroidery scissors](https://www.sewessential.co.uk/sewing-tools-and-gadgets/sewing-tools/scissors/embroidery-scissors) or a small pair of craft scissors will suffice.

### Needle threader

A [needle threader](https://www.amazon.co.uk/DMC-6112-Aluminum-Needle-Threader/dp/B000YZALOG) is a tool to help you thread needles more easily.
It's not an essential tool for cross stitching, but it may help if you find threading the needle difficult.

### Needle minder

A needle minder is a small magnet that stitchers attach to their fabric while they work.
The needle is attracted to the magnet and prevents it from becoming lost between crafting sessions.
Again, this is not an essential tool, but it can be useful to keep track of your needle and also you can buy needle minders in a lot of [fun designs](https://www.etsy.com/uk/search?q=needle%20minder&ref=auto-1&as_prefix=needle).
