### Pattern chart

The pattern chart is a gridded piece of paper that lays out the design we'd like to stitch.
Each square on the grid represents one full cross stitch and the grid often has a 10x10 square grid in **bold** to assist with counting.
The pattern chart will contain symbols within the grid and a key that links each symbol to the number of coloured thread we should use to create that stitch with.
The colours and layout of the stitches will help build up our pattern.
