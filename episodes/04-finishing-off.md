In this chapter you will learn what to do when you run out of thread while stitching, finish working with one colour and need to move on to the next one, or finished your design. 

You will have to start by tying a secure knot on the backside of your pattern on the back of the fabric.

Start by running your current threaded needle underneath the back of 3 or 4 stitches. 
Do this a couple of times to create an anchor.

This will prevent your stitches from coming un-done.
Cut the loose tail of the thread as close to the fabric as you can.
