# Cross Stitching is like Computer Programming

Computer programming or coding requires analytical skills.
These skills allow us to think of a solution to a problem, design a plan comprising of multiple steps and accomplish them by writing multiple lines of code. 
Each of these lines have been intentionally written to play a vital role in a software package or analytical pipeline.

Cross stitching is quite like programming where the input is the combination of colours, the algorithm is the pattern chart, and the output is a beautiful design you have created.

As you stitch, you have to decode the pattern symbols into thread colours and the pattern is often built up across rows.
If there’s a bug or mis-stitching in a row, you have to fix that to create your pattern as you intended it to look like.

Keeping that in mind, we invite you to explore cross-stitching as a hobby for programmers. 
This lesson is designed to train a beginner to learn how to cross stitch and use it as a hobby to mindfully enjoy their breaks from work.

# Why cross stitch as a programmer?

On a daily basis, we use smartphones and computers for everything we do. 
Starting from getting a fast access to news and latest information in the morning, to learning a new programming language or other skills to getting our job done at work, to ordering things that makes our day-to-day life possible.
Needless to say, such excessive use of technology leads to information overload, and often results into burnout and other mental health issues including anxiety, and depression [1].

# Mindful Hobbies in Digital Age

> *Mindfulness and technology is a movement in research and design, that encourages the user to become aware of the present moment, rather than losing oneself in a technological device. This field encompasses multidisciplinary participation between design, psychology, computer science, and religion.* Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindfulness_and_technology)

Mindfulness has been theoretically and empirically associated with psychological well-being [2]. 
Practicing mindfulness through a habby is an easy way to intentionally separate our 'down-time' from 'work-time' and boost our wellbeing. 
It is also recommended by National Institute for Health and Care Excellence to boost attention and concentration, and to prevent recurrent depression [3].
